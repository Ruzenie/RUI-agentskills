# UI Aesthetic Rubric

Score each dimension from 1 to 5.

## 1. Visual Hierarchy
- 1: Primary action and content priority are unclear.
- 3: Major sections are distinguishable but weakly prioritized.
- 5: Attention flow is obvious within 3 seconds.
Improve by: stronger size contrast, reduced competing accents, clearer section rhythm.

## 2. Typography
- 1: Random sizes/weights; poor readability.
- 3: Basic consistency but limited rhythm.
- 5: Clear type scale, purposeful weight usage, stable reading cadence.
Improve by: define 5-7-step type scale, limit font families, normalize line-height.

## 3. Color System
- 1: Decorative color chaos; semantics unclear.
- 3: Main palette exists but weak semantic mapping.
- 5: Semantic tokens are consistent (surface/text/border/state/accent).
Improve by: map colors to roles first, reduce accent count, tune neutral ramps.

## 4. Spacing and Rhythm
- 1: Uneven padding/margins; clutter or dead zones.
- 3: Mostly consistent with occasional breakage.
- 5: Predictable spacing grid and balanced breathing room.
Improve by: adopt 4/8pt grid, define container and section spacing tiers.

## 5. Component Consistency
- 1: Buttons/cards/inputs feel unrelated.
- 3: Reusable patterns exist but variant rules are fuzzy.
- 5: Shared component language across states and contexts.
Improve by: standardize radius, border style, elevation, and control heights.

## 6. Brand and Personality
- 1: Generic template feel; no distinct voice.
- 3: Some brand signals but inconsistent tone.
- 5: Distinct visual voice while preserving usability.
Improve by: define 3 brand adjectives and map each to concrete UI decisions.

## 7. Interaction Clarity
- 1: State feedback missing or ambiguous.
- 3: Key states present but inconsistent.
- 5: State transitions and affordances are immediate and predictable.
Improve by: define canonical state set for each interactive component.

## Score Interpretation
- 7-14: Foundational redesign needed.
- 15-24: Moderate refactor with system cleanup.
- 25-30: Strong baseline; focus on brand expression and polish.
- 31-35: High visual maturity; optimize edge cases.
